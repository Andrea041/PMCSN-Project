# Study of a Car Sharing Service with queuing theory
Car sharing systems are emerging as an innovative and practical solution to the challenges of modern urban mobility. By offering an alternative to private car ownership, these services enable users to access vehicles only when needed, eliminating the responsibilities and costs associated with owning a car. Thanks to their flexibility, car sharing systems can help reduce the total number of vehicles on the road, thereby alleviating traffic congestion and decreasing air pollution. Additionally, they optimize the use of parking spaces and territorial resources, enhancing urban livability and sustainability.

In this study, we examine the case of GoFun, a car sharing company founded in China that offers short-term car rental services. Through its mobile app, GoFun allows users to book, unlock, and use vehicles, paying only for the time and distance traveled. A distinctive aspect of GoFun is its commitment to environmental sustainability, with a fleet composed entirely of electric cars to minimize CO2 emissions. Using queuing theory and simulation, our study analyzes GoFunâ€™s operational model, exploring the effectiveness of its management strategies and the environmental impact of the service.
